## 1 Introduction

three-tile is a lightweight 3D tile map library developed based on [threejs](https://threejs.org/). It offers advantages such as ease of use and low resource consumption, and provides a lightweight 3D terrain model suitable for adding 3D maps to applications developed with threejs.

Disclaimer:

- This framework does not contain any map data. The maps used in the examples directly call third-party data. Please comply with legal and regulatory requirements when using them.

### 1.1 Features

- Lightweight: The map is provided as a 3D model, without any impact on the existing program architecture.
- Few dependencies: The entire framework only has one dependency, which is threejs (R165).
- Fast: Low resource consumption, capable of running smoothly at 60FPS even on integrated graphics.
- Easy to use: Familiarity with threejs means virtually no learning curve.
- Highly extensible: Data, models, textures, materials, and the rendering process can all be extended and replaced according to your needs.

### 1.2 Development Environment

- Language: 100% TypeScript
- IDE: VSCode
- Bundler: Vite 4.0
